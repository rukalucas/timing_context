    Transition task with adjustable cue probability for curriculum learning.

    Uses simple per-trial cue_probability to control what fraction of trials receive
    explicit rule cues. This allows smooth interpolation between fully instructed
    (cue_probability=1.0) and fully inferred (cue_probability=0.0) tasks.

    Block Structure:
    - Block length = block_min + geometric(1/block_mean)
    - Each trial shows cue with probability cue_probability (independent per trial)
    - Rules alternate between blocks
